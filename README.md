### HW2

image rectifications

### HW3

stitch images to a panorama, those images must be taken with camera center fixed. The camera rotate around its camera center while taking those images.

### HW4

Estimate 3D points cloud using 2-View Geometry.

camera fundamental matrix
camera intrinsic matrix K
To compute 3D point X, I use Linear triangulation method.
